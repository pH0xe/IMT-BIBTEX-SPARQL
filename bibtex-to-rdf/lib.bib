  abstract =     {Abstract We have designed and implemented a type inference algorithm for the SELF language. The algorithm can guarantee the safety and disambiguity of message sends, and provide useful information for browsers and optimizing compilers. SELF features objects with dynamic inheritance. This construct has until now been considered incompatible with type inference because it allows the inheritance graph to change dynamically. Our algorithm handles this by deriving and solving type constraints that simultaneously define supersets of both the possible values of expressions and of the possible inheritance graphs. The apparent circularity is resolved by computing a global fixed-point, in polynomial time. The algorithm has been implemented and can successfully handle the SELF benchmark programs, which exist in the âstandard SELF worldâ of more than 40,000 lines of code.},

An internal DSL is an extension of an existing programming language, the host language, offering the user of the DSL domain-specific constructs as well as the constructs of the host language, thus providing a richer language than the DSL itself. In this paper we report on experiences implementing external as well as internal formal modeling DSLs with the Scala programming language, known in particular for its support for defining DSLs. The modeling languages include monitoring logics, a testing language, and a general purpose SysML inspired modeling language. We present a systematic overview of advantages and disadvantages of each option.},

  abstract =     {We present a translation from Fickle, a small object-oriented language allowing objects to change their class at runtime, into Java. The translation is provenly correct in the sense that it preserves the static and dynamic semantics. Moreover, it is compatible with separate compilation, since the translation of a Fickle class does not depend on the implementation of used classes. Based on the formal system, we have developed an implementation.

The translation turned out to be a more subtle problem than we expected. In this article, we discuss four possible approaches we considered for the design of the translation and to justify our choice, we present formally the translation and proof of preservation of the static and dynamic semantics, and discuss the prototype implementation. Moreover, we outline an alternative translation based on generics that avoids most of the casts (but not all) needed in the previous translation.

The language Fickle has undergone and is still undergoing several phases of development. In this article we are discussing the translation of Fickle_{II}}

  abstract =     {Large volumes of spatio-temporal data are increasingly collected and studied in diverse domains, including climate science, social sciences, neuroscience, epidemiology, transportation, mobile health, and Earth sciences. Spatio-temporal data differ from relational data for which computational approaches are developed in the data-mining community for multiple decades in that both spatial and temporal attributes are available in addition to the actual measurements/attributes. The presence of these attributes introduces additional challenges that needs to be dealt with. Approaches for mining spatio-temporal data have been studied for over a decade in the data-mining community. In this article, we present a broad survey of this relatively young field of spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types of spatio-temporal data and the relevant data-mining questions that arise in the context of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on the nature of the data-mining problem studied, we classify literature on spatio-temporal data mining into six major categories: clustering, predictive learning, change detection, frequent pattern mining, anomaly detection, and relationship mining. We discuss the various forms of spatio-temporal data-mining problems in each of these categories.},

Compared to Everything-as-a-Service (*aaS), resources are categorized into computational, consumed, and produced, have trackable lifecycles as per their respective category, and are customized in order to consider the characteristics of future resource-based collaborative applications to develop. From a capacity perspective, a computational resource processes data, a produced resource abstracts data, and a consumed resource captures data. Along with their capacities, resources expose methods that other resources and/or applicationsâ stakeholders call. The proper call of methods is ensured through restrictions like limited and non-shareable. This paper exemplifies the *aaR paradigm with a case study that revolves around the use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the healthcare domain. The case study is implemented in a RESTful fashion along with some standard Web technologies and protocols. The evaluation of IoTR4HealthCare system is benchmarked against two existing systems using cost and latency criteria.},

Because aggregation is known to have no accurate semantics, a trend is to propose in a given object modeling language several aggregation patterns. However, conventional aggregation and composition in UML aren't sufficient because other aggregation semantics resulting from domain-specific requirements, are needed. In that connection, an object-oriented framework called cOlOr allows to properly deal with common and special structural relationships.},

A reflection elegantly describes the situation where there is a kernel of the source language that is isomorphic to the target language. However, we believe that the reflection criteria is so strong that it often excludes the usual situation in compiling where one is compiling from a higher-level to a lower-level language.},

We find that naively encoding such systems in bigraphs is somewhat awkward; and we propose a more sophisticated modeling technique, introducing Plato-graphical models, alleviating this awkwardness. We argue that such models are useful for simulation and point out that for reasoning about such bigraphical models, the bisimilarity inherent to bigraphical reactive systems is not enough in itself; an equivalence between the bigraphical reactive systems themselves is also needed.},

We show that inheritance oers new specialization opportunities but that these opportunities are not so easy to benet from because of some deep incompatibilities between specialization as partial evaluation and specialization as inheritance in standard object-oriented languages.},

  abstract=      {Current software cost estimation models, such as the 1981 Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) for software cost estimation and its 1987 Ada COCOMO update, have been experiencing increasing difficulties in estimating the costs of software developed to new life cycle processes and capabilities. These include non-sequential and rapid-development process models; reuse-driven approaches involving commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) packages, re-engineering, applications composition, and applications generation capabilities; object-oriented approaches supported by distributed middleware; and software process maturity initiatives. This paper summarizes research in deriving a baseline COCOMO 2.0 model tailored to these new forms of software development, including rationale for the model decisions. The major new modeling capabilities of COCOMO 2.0 are a tailorable family of software sizing models, involving Object Points, Function Points, and Source Lines of Code; nonlinear models for software reuse and re-engineering; an exponentdriver approach for modeling relative software diseconomies of scale; and several additions, deletions and updates to previous COCOMO effort-multiplier cost drivers. This model is serving as a framework for an extensive current data collection and analysis effort to further refine and calibrate the model's estimation capabilities.},

  abstract =     {Positional data from small and mobile Global Positioning Systems has become ubiquitous and allows for many new applications such as road traffic or vessel monitoring as well as location-based services. To make these applications possible, for which information on location is more important than ever, streaming spatial data needs to be managed, mined, and used intelligently. This article provides an overview of previous work in this evolving research field and discusses different applications as well as common problems and solutions. The conclusion indicates promising directions for future research.},

                  obtained by combining a monovariant BTA and a polyvariant
                  specializer. This relies on first transforming the program
                  to be specialized in order to include the computation of 
                  the binding times of each function parameter. In particular
                  a new parameter is associated to each function parameter. 
                  The parameter gives the binding time of the initial 
                  parameter. The new program can then be partially evaluated,
                  using a monovariant BTA, with respect to the binding times 
                  of the entry point. The effect of this first 
                  specialization is to create clones of functions for which
                  different call binding-time patterns exist. The resulting
                  program can then be partially evaluated with respect to the
                  actual static input data.
                  A way of dealing with partially static conditionals, based
                  on the same kind of technique, is also sketched.},

  abstract =     {The components of a loosely coupled system are typically designed to operate by generating and responding to asynchronous events. An event notification service is an application-independent infrastructure that supports the construction of event-based systems, whereby generators of events publish event notifications to the infrastructure and consumers of events subscribe with the infrastructure to receive relevant notifications. The two primary services that should be provided to components by the infrastructure are notification selection (i. e., determining which notifications match which subscriptions) and notification delivery (i.e., routing matching notifications from publishers to subscribers). Numerous event notification services have been developed for local-area networks, generally based on a centralized server to select and deliver event notifications. Therefore, they suffer from an inherent inability to scale to wide-area networks, such as the Internet, where the number and physical distribution of the service's clients can quickly overwhelm a centralized solution. The critical challenge in the setting of a wide-area network is to maximize the expressiveness in the selection mechanism without sacrificing scalability in the delivery mechanism. This paper presents SIENA, an event notification service that we have designed and implemented to exhibit both expressiveness and scalability. We describe the service's interface to applications, the algorithms used by networks of servers to select and deliver event notifications, and the strategies used to optimize performance. We also present results of simulation studies that examine the scalability and performance of the service.},

  abstract =     {We argue that the needs of many classes of modern applications, especially those targeted at mobile or wireless computing, demand the services of content-based publish/subscribe middleware, and that this middleware in turn demands a new kind of communication infrastructure for its proper implementation. We refer to this new communication infrastructure as content-based networking. The service model of this network must directly support the interface of an advanced contentbased publish/subscribe middleware service. At the same time, the implementation must be architected as a true distributed network, providing appropriate guarantees of reliability, security, and performance. We do not propose content-based networking as a replacement for IP, nor do we advocate an implementation of a publish/subscribe middleware at the network level (i.e., within routers). Instead, we argue that contentbased networking must be designed according to established networking principles and techniques. To this end, in this paper, we formulate the foundational concepts of content-based networking, and relate them to the corresponding concepts in traditional networking. We also briefly review our experience with content-based publish/subscribe middleware and suggest some open research problems in the area of content-based networking.},

  abstract =     {Despite the substantial progress in compiler testing, research endeavors have mainly focused on detecting compiler crashes and subtle miscompilations caused by bugs in the implementation of compiler optimizations. Surprisingly, this growing body of work neglects other compiler components, most notably the front-end. In statically-typed programming languages with rich and expressive type systems and modern features, such as type inference or a mix of object-oriented with functional programming features, the process of static typing in compiler front-ends is complicated by a high-density of bugs. Such bugs can lead to the acceptance of incorrect programs (breaking code portability or the type system's soundness), the rejection of correct (e.g. well-typed) programs, and the reporting of misleading errors and warnings. We conduct, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study for understanding and characterizing typing-related compiler bugs. To do so, we manually study 320 typing-related bugs (along with their fixes and test cases) that are randomly sampled from four mainstream JVM languages, namely Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Groovy. We evaluate each bug in terms of several aspects, including their symptom, root cause, bug fix's size, and the characteristics of the bug-revealing test cases. Some representative observations indicate that: (1) more than half of the typing-related bugs manifest as unexpected compile-time errors: the buggy compiler wrongly rejects semantically correct programs, (2) the majority of typing-related bugs lie in the implementations of the underlying type systems and in other core components related to operations on types, (3) parametric polymorphism is the most pervasive feature in the corresponding test cases, (4) one third of typing-related bugs are triggered by non-compilable programs. We believe that our study opens up a new research direction by driving future researchers to build appropriate methods and techniques for a more holistic testing of compilers.},

                  to produce high-quality code for programs written in
                  a heavily-object-oriented style. To achieve this
                  end, Vortex includes a number of intra- and 
		  interprocedural static analyses that can exploit
		  knowledge about the whole program being compiled,
		  including intraprocedural class analysis, class
		  hierarchy analysis, and exhaustive class testing,
		  and profile-guided optimizations such as receiver
		  class prediction and selective specialization. To
		  make whole-program optimization practical, Vortex
		  automatically tracks cross-file optimization
		  dependencies at a fine granularity, triggering
		  selective recompilation of affected compiled files
		  whenever the source program changes. Empirical
		  measurements of five purely object-oriented
		  benchmark programs written in Cecil, ranging in size
		  from several hundred to 75,000 lines of source code,
		  indicate that these optimization techniques improve
		  performance of large programs by more than a factor
		  of three over a system with only intraprocedural
		  static optimizations.  Vortex is written in Cecil,
		  and it has been used as its own compiler and
		  optimizer during its development for the past two
		  years. Vortex's optimizations and implementation
		  techniques should be useful for any language or
		  program where optimizations to reduce the cost of
		  polymorphism are important, including
		  object-oriented languages (we are currently adding
		  front-ends for C++, Modula-3, and Java to Vortex to
		  study its effectiveness on these other language
		  styles) and other high-level symbolic, functional,
		  and logic languages.}

  abstract =     {Autoscaling system can reconfigure cloud-based services and applications, through various configurations of cloud software and provisions of hardware resources, to adapt to the changing environment at runtime. Such a behavior offers the foundation for achieving elasticity in a modern cloud computing paradigm. Given the dynamic and uncertain nature of the shared cloud infrastructure, the cloud autoscaling system has been engineered as one of the most complex, sophisticated, and intelligent artifacts created by humans, aiming to achieve self-aware, self-adaptive, and dependable runtime scaling. Yet the existing Self-aware and Self-adaptive Cloud Autoscaling System (SSCAS) is not at a state where it can be reliably exploited in the cloud. In this article, we survey the state-of-the-art research studies on SSCAS and provide a comprehensive taxonomy for this field. We present detailed analysis of the results and provide insights on open challenges, as well as the promising directions that are worth investigated in the future work of this area of research. Our survey and taxonomy contribute to the fundamentals of engineering more intelligent autoscaling systems in the cloud.},

  abstract =     {Software-intensive systems in most domains, from autonomous vehicles to health, are becoming predominantly parallel to efficiently manage large amount of data in short (even real-) time. There is an incredibly rich literature on languages for parallel computing, thus it is difficult for researchers and practitioners, even experienced in this very field, to get a grasp on them. With this work we provide a comprehensive, structured, and detailed snapshot of documented research on those languages to identify trends, technical characteristics, open challenges, and research directions. In this article, we report on planning, execution, and results of our systematic peer-reviewed as well as grey literature review, which aimed at providing such a snapshot by analysing 225 studies.},

Dead-code elimination and loop-invariant removal are implemented and tested, as well as several variations of the side-effect analysis. The optimizer is tested on real-world applications such as itself and JavaSoft's Java compiler. Results show that the optimizations benefit well from the side-effect analysis. The best side-effect analysis gives five to ten times as many optimizations as without an analysis, and, in one case, makes a speed increase of 25\% possible. Â© 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract =     {Fog computing is a paradigm that brings computational resources and services to the network edge in the vicinity of user devices, lowering latency and connecting with cloud computing resources. Unlike cloud computing, fog resources are based on constrained and heterogeneous nodes whose connectivity can be unstable. In this complex scenario, there is a need to define and implement orchestration processes to ensure that applications and services can be provided, considering the settled agreements. Although some publications have dealt with orchestration in fog computing, there are still some diverse definitions and functional intersection with other areas, such as resource management and monitoring. This article presents a systematic review of the literature with focus on orchestration in fog computing. A generic architecture of fog orchestration is presented, created from the consolidation of the analyzed proposals, bringing to light the essential functionalities addressed in the literature. This work also highlights the main challenges and open research questions.},

Complex events, involving several, related events, cannot be detected. To overcome this limitation, we designed RACED, an adaptive middleware, which extends the content-based publish-subscribe paradigm to provide a complex event detection service for large scale scenarios. In this paper we describe its main aspects: the event definition language; the protocol enabling efficient and distributed detection of complex events through a network of service brokers; the mechanism that enables RACED to dynamically adapt to network traffic. A preliminary evaluation shows the benefits of RACED w.r.t. more traditional publish-subscribe infrastructures.},

  abstract =     {Partial evaluation specializes terms, but traditionally this specialization does not apply to the type of these terms. As a result, specializing, e.g., an interpreter written in a typed language, which requires a ``universal'' type to encode expressible values, yields residual programs with type tags all over. Neil Jones has stated that getting rid of these type tags was an open problem, despite possible solutions such as Torben Mogensen's ``constructor specialization.'' To solve this problem, John Hughes has proposed a new paradigm for partial evaluation, ``Type Specialization'', based on type inference instead of being based on symbolic interpretation. Type Specialization is very elegant in principle but it also appears non-trivial in practice.},

Because it is first-order, reasoning about it does not require the use of a logical relation. This new CPS transformation connects two separate lines of research. It has already been used to state a new and simpler correctness proof of a direct-style transformation, and to develop a new and simpler CPS transformation of control-flow information.},

Previous CPS transformations only enjoyed two out of the three properties of being first-order, one-pass, and compositional, but the new transformation enjoys all three properties. It is proved correct directly by structural induction over source terms instead of indirectly with a colon translation, as in Plotkin's original proof. Similarly, it makes it possible to reason about CPS-transformed terms by structural induction over source terms, directly. The new CPS transformation connects separately published approaches to the CPS transformation. It has already been used to state a new and simpler correctness proof of a direct-style transformation, and to develop a new and simpler CPS transformation of control-flow information.},

Such systems pose specific challenges in all phases of software development lifecycle and might become very complex by evolving data, technologies, and target value over time. Consequently, many organizations and enterprises have found it difficult to adopt BDSs. In this article, we provide insight into three major activities of software engineering in the context of BDSs as well as the choices made to tackle them regarding state-of-the-art research and industry efforts. These activities include the engineering of requirements, designing and constructing software to meet the specified requirements, and software/data quality assurance. We also disclose some open challenges of developing effective BDSs, which need attention from both researchers and practitioners.},

  abstract =     { Git is a widely used version control system that is powerful but complicated. Its complexity may not be an inevitable consequence of its power but rather evidence of flaws in its design. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed the design of Git using a theory that identifies concepts, purposes, and misfits. Some well-known difficulties with Git are described, and explained as misfits in which underlying concepts fail to meet their intended purpose. Based on this analysis, we designed a reworking of Git (called Gitless) that attempts to remedy these flaws. To correlate misfits with issues reported by users, we conducted a study of Stack Overflow questions. And to determine whether users experienced fewer complications using Gitless in place of Git, we conducted a small user study. Results suggest our approach can be profitable in identifying, analyzing, and fixing design problems. },

  abstract =     {Modern-day software development shows a number of feedback loops between various phases in its life cycle; object-oriented software is particularly prone to this. Whereas descending through the different levels of abstraction is relatively straightforward and well supported by methods and tools, the synthesis of design information from an evolving implementation is far from obvious. This is why in many instances, analysis and design is used to initiate software development while evolution is directly applied to the implementation. Keeping design information synchronized is often reduced to a token activity, the first to be sacrificed in the face of time constraints. In this light, architectural styles are particularly difficult to enforce, since they can, by their very nature, be seen to crosscut an implementation. This contribution reports on a number of experiments to use logic meta-programming (LMP) to augment an implementation with enforceable design concerns, including architectural concerns. LMP is an instance of hybrid language symbiosis, merging a declarative (logic) meta-level language with a standard object-oriented base language. This approach can be used to codify design information as constraints or even as a process for code generation. LMP is an emerging technique, not yet quite out of the lab. However, it has already been shown to be very expressive: it incorporates mechanisms such as pre/post conditions and aspect-oriented programming. We found the promise held by LMP extremely attractive, hence this chapter.},

  abstract =     {This paper evaluates three alias analyses based on programming language types. The first analysis uses type compatibility to determine aliases. The second extends the first by using additional high-level information such as field names. The third extends the second with a flow-insensitive analysis. Although other researchers suggests using types to disambiguate memory references, none evaluates its effectiveness. We perform both static and dynamic evaluations of type-based alias analyses for Modula-3, a statically-typed type-safe language. The static analysis reveals that type compatibility alone yields a very imprecise alias analysis, but the other two analyses significantly improve alias precision. We use redundant load elimination (RLE) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the three alias algorithms in terms of the opportunities for optimization, the impact on simulated execution times, and to compute an upper bound on what a perfect alias analysis would yield. We show modest dynamic improvements for (RLE), and more surprisingly, that on average our alias analysis is within 2.5\% of a perfect alias analysis with respect to RLE on 8 Modula-3 programs. These results illustrate that to explore thoroughly the effectiveness of alias analyses, researchers need static, dynamic, and upper-bound analysis. In addition, we show that for type-safe languages like Modula-3 and Java, a fast and simple alias analysis may be sufficient for many applications.},

                  concerns at the implementation level. However, aspects are
                  not always orthogonal and aspect interaction is an
                  important problem. Currently there is almost no support for
                  the detection and resolution of such interactions. The
                  programmer is responsible for identifying interactions
                  between conflicting aspects and implementing conflict
                  resolution code.
                  
                  In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem based
                  on a generic framework for AOP. The contributions are
                  threefold: we present a formal and expressive crosscut
                  language, two static conflict analyses and some linguistic
                  support for conflict resolution.},

The deployment and dynamic reconfiguration of cloud applications, involving the addition/removal of virtual machines and components hosted on these virtual machines, are error-prone tasks. They must preserve the application consistency and respect important architectural invariants related to software dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a protocol for automating these reconfiguration tasks. In order to ensure its correctness and robustness, we implement the protocol with the support of the Maude system for rapid prototyping purposes, and we verify it with its formal analysis tools.},

As a result, there is some confusion about issues related to implementing patterns in a non OO setting and interesting issues about components. Actually, it is not clear that the full power of units is required by the application, eg there is no example of recursive definitions. Nice analysis and related work sections.}

  abstract =     {Cloud Federation is an emerging computing model where multiple resources from independent Cloud providers are leveraged to create large-scale distributed virtual computing clusters, operating as into a single Cloud organization. This model enables the implementation of environmental diversity for Cloud applications, and overcomes the provisioning and scalability limits of a single Cloud, by introducing minimal additional cost for the Cloud consumer. In such a scenario, it is necessary to leverage on specific networking technologies that enable the effective support of inter-Cloud communication services between Cloud providers. This paper proposes an interconnection solution for Cloud federations based on publish/subscribe services. Moreover, we discuss some fundamental concerns needed to satisfy the inter-Cloud communication requirements in terms of reliability and availability. Finally, we present some experimental results that highlight some key reliability and denial of service vulnerability concerns in this domain.},

They capture the intent behind a design by identifying objects, their collaborations, and the distribution of responsibilities. Design patterns play many roles in the object-oriented development process: they provide a common vocabulary for design, they reduce system complexity by naming and defining abstractions, they constitute a base of experience for building reusable software, and they act as building blocks from which more complex designs can be built. Design patterns can be considered reusable micro-architectures that contribute to an overall system architecture. We describe how to express and organize design patterns and introduce a catalog of design patterns. We also describe our experience in applying design patterns to the design of object-oriented systems.},

In the context of âIndustrial Internetâ, where the operation of complex physical machinery is integrated with networked sensors and software applications, IoT is under- stood as a technological enabler of significant advances in the efficiency of industrial processes. In this paper, we elaborate on the main challenges brought on by the Industrial Internet and identify its key enabling technologies relevant to the Fog Computing paradigm. Further on, we propose the introduction of an Adaptive Operations Platform (AOP) to provide end-to- end manageability of the enabling Fog Computing infrastructure according to the operational requirements of industrial process. We present our prototype setup for AOP and elaborate on its performance evaluation in a typical industrial scenario.},

  abstract =     {Recursive definition of streams (infinite lists of values) have been proposed as a fundamental programming structure in various fields. A problem is to turn such expressive recursive definitions into an efficient imperative code for their evaluation. One of the main approach is to restrict the stream expressions to interpret them as a temporal sequence of values. Such sequential stream rely on a clock analysis to decide at what time a new stream value must be produced. In this paper we present a denotational semantics of recursively defined sequential streams. We show how an efficient implementation can be derived as guarded statements wrapped into a single imperative loop.},

  abstract =     {The cloud-computing paradigm offers on-demand services over the Internet and supports a wide variety of applications. With the recent growth of Internet of Things (IoT)--based applications, the use of cloud services is increasing exponentially. The next generation of cloud computing must be energy efficient and sustainable to fulfill end-user requirements, which are changing dynamically. Presently, cloud providers are facing challenges to ensure the energy efficiency and sustainability of their services. The use of a large number of cloud datacenters increases cost as well as carbon footprints, which further affects the sustainability of cloud services. In this article, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable cloud computing. The taxonomy is used to investigate the existing techniques for sustainability that need careful attention and investigation as proposed by several academic and industry groups. The current research on sustainable cloud computing is organized into several categories: application design, sustainability metrics, capacity planning, energy management, virtualization, thermal-aware scheduling, cooling management, renewable energy, and waste heat utilization. The existing techniques have been compared and categorized based on common characteristics and properties. A conceptual model for sustainable cloud computing has been presented along with a discussion on future research directions.},

We present an algorithm that underlines the untypable parts of a program and assigns types to the rest. The algorithm is derived in a simple manner from the well-known algorithm W of Damas and Milner \cite{Damas-Milner:popl82}.
                 Our algorithm provides us with an easy solution to the problem of doing binding time analysis of the untyped higher order lambda calculus, and therby of the wide range of programming languages based upon the lambda calculus. The techniques can also be used to eliminate superfluous runtime type checking in untyped functional languages, to produce better error messages from type analyzers for strongly typed languages, and to analyze feasability of arity raising.},

  abstract =     {The ability to use version control systems is a highly desired skill in the software industry and the need to teach it has been recognized in the literature. Git, and other version control systems, have previously been used by instructors in classrooms to distribute exercises, to facilitate assessment, and as a platform for project collaboration and teamwork. Using version control brings benefits to instructors, e.g. by lowering the need for administrative tasks, as well as to students, e.g. by providing experience with standard software industry tools. We describe how to incrementally present features of Git and incorporate them into the course workflow. We present a case study of running a large (ca. 200 students) course utilizing Git and evaluate the results both from instructor's and learner's point of view. Our evaluation shows, that a distributed version control system can be used successfully to disseminate course materials and facilitate exercise submissions.},

A broad class of systems, termed reactive, is singled out as being particularly problematic when it comes to finding satisfactory methods for behavioral description. In this paper we recommend the recently proposed statechart method for this purpose. Moreover, it is observed that most reactive systems cannot be developed in a linear stepwise fashion, but, rather, give rise to a two-dimensional development process, featuring behavioral aspects in the one dimension and implementational ones in the other. Concurrency may occur in both dimensions, as orthogonality of states in the one and as parallelism of subsystems in the other. A preliminary approach to working one's way through this ``magic square'' of system development is then presented. The ideas described herein seem to be relevant to a wide variety of application areas.},

  abstract =     {The world is becoming a more conjunct place and the number of data sources such as social networks, online transactions, web search engines, and mobile devices is increasing even more than had been predicted. A large percentage of this growing dataset exists in the form of linked data, more generally, graphs, and of unprecedented sizes. While today's data from social networks contain hundreds of millions of nodes connected by billions of edges, inter-connected data from globally distributed sensors that forms the Internet of Things can cause this to grow exponentially larger. Although analyzing these large graphs is critical for the companies and governments that own them, big data tools designed for text and tuple analysis such as MapReduce cannot process them efficiently. So, graph distributed processing abstractions and systems are developed to design iterative graph algorithms and process large graphs with better performance and scalability. These graph frameworks propose novel methods or extend previous methods for processing graph data. In this article, we propose a taxonomy of graph processing systems and map existing systems to this classification. This captures the diversity in programming and computation models, runtime aspects of partitioning and communication, both for in-memory and distributed frameworks. Our effort helps to highlight key distinctions in architectural approaches, and identifies gaps for future research in scalable graph systems.},

However, a number of serious concerns have been raised recently, questioning whether todayâs computational work is adequately reproducible. In principle, it should be possible to specify a computation to sufficient detail that anyone should be able to reproduce it exactly. But in practice, there are fundamental, technical, and social barriers to doing so. The many objectives and meanings of reproducibility are discussed within the context of scientific computing. Technical barriers to reproducibility are described, extant approaches surveyed, and open areas of research are identified.},

  abstract =     {Despite excellent results on pilot projects, formal validation based on standard Formal Description Techniques (FDTs) never really catch up in the industry. We claim that this is mainly due to standard FDTs lack of support for the modern software development methods and life-cycles needed in the construction and maintenance of open distributed systems. We propose to go the other way round, that is to integrate formal validation technology within well established object-oriented (OO) development methods. Building on the intuition that a universal language taking into account all the possible semantics aspects of parallelism and communication is a holy grail, we propose to rely on an open (but simpler) OO language to build dedicated frameworks. Such frameworks can be specialized toward classes of distributed applications, and integrate formal validation tools. We illustrate our approach using the famous alternating bit protocol example. We investigate on this example how a continuous validation framework could be set up to go smoothly from the OO analysis to the OO implementation of a validated distributed system.},

  abstract =     {In designing a product-line architecture (PLA), it is important to analyze common and variable requirements in a product family. These requirements must be analyzed not only from the functional aspect but also from aspects related to quality attributes such as performance and reliability. For example, if two products are required to attain different levels of performance, architectures for these products may be different even if they provide the same functionality. In this paper, we propose an aspect-oriented analysis method for PLA design in which we analyze product requirements from each aspect separately. In the method, we identify important factors for each quality attribute, and characterize the services in terms of the factors. Based on the characterization, we separate requirements related to each quality attribute from the original requirements. Using the method, we can examine the architecture styles required for a PLA from each aspect, which can make PLA design easier.},

It sometimes becomes difficult to have a clear vision of how all those concepts are interwoven and what benefits they bring to the global picture (either from a service or business perspective). This paper traces the evolution of the manufacturing paradigms, highlighting the recent shift towards Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg), along with a taxonomy of the technological concepts and technologies underlying CMfg.},

Announced without fanfare in 2004, implicits have quickly grown to become a widely and pervasively used feature of the language. They provide a way to reduce the boilerplate code in Scala programs. They are also used to implement certain language features without having to modify the compiler. We report on a large-scale study of the use of implicits in the wild. For this, we analyzed 7,280 Scala projects hosted on GitHub, spanning over 8.1M call sites involving implicits and 370.7K implicit declarations across 18.7M lines of Scala code.},

  abstract =     {We study the fundamental limitations of relational algebra (RA) and SQL in supporting sequence and stream queries, and present effective query language and data model enrichments to deal with them. We begin by observing the well-known limitations of SQL in application domains which are important for data streams, such as sequence queries and data mining. Then we present a formal proof that, for continuous queries on data streams, SQL suffers from additional expressive power problems. We begin by focusing on the notion of nonblocking (NB) queries that are the only continuous queries that can be supported on data streams. We characterize the notion of nonblocking queries by showing that they are equivalent to monotonic queries. Therefore the notion of NB-completeness for RA can be formalized as its ability to express all monotonic queries expressible in RA using only the monotonic operators of RA. We show that RA is not NB-complete, and SQL is not more powerful than RA for monotonic queries.To solve these problems, we propose extensions that allow SQL to support all the monotonic queries expressible by a Turing machine using only monotonic operators. We show that these extensions are (i) user-defined aggregates (UDAs) natively coded in SQL (rather than in an external language), and (ii) a generalization of the union operator to support the merging of multiple streams according to their timestamps. These query language extensions require matching extensions to basic relational data model to support sequences explicitly ordered by times-tamps. Along with the formulation of very powerful queries, the proposed extensions entail more efficient expressions for many simple queries. In particular, we show that nonblocking queries are simple to characterize according to their syntactic structure.},

		  parallel computation based on either shared memory
		  or message passing. Since the programming model
		  dictates so many aspects of the implementation of an
		  application, including process decomposition and
		  scheduling, the choice of programming model is a
		  dominant factor in application performance. In this
		  paper we argue that the choice between the
		  shared-memory and message-passing models depends on
		  two factors: the relative cost of communication and
		  computation as implemented by the hardware, and the
		  degree of load imbalance inherent in the
		  application. We use two representative applications
		  to illustrate the performance advantages of each
		  programming model on several different shared-memory
		  machines, including the BBN Butterfly, Sequent
		  Symmetry, Encore Multimax, and Silicon Graphics Iris
		  multiprocessors. We show that applications
		  implemented in the shared-memory model perform
		  better on the previous generation of
		  multiprocessors, while applications implemented in
		  the message-passing model perform better on modern
		  multiprocessors. We argue that both models have
		  performance advantages, and that the factors that
		  influence the choice of model may not be known at
		  compile-time. As a compromise solution, we propose
		  an alternative programming model, which has the load
		  balancing properties of the shared-memory model and
		  the locality properties of the message-passing
		  model, and show that this new model performs better
		  than the other two alternatives.},

		  constructed for each layer. Local memory management
		  policies are implemented using mechanisms that are
		  independent of the architectural configuration;
		  global policies are implemented using multiple
		  processes that increase in number as the
		  architecture scales. Psyche currently runs on the
		  BBN Butterfly Plus multiprocessor. This paper
		  describes an ambitious early design for a VM system
		  for Psyche. Our plans for VM were scaled back
		  substantially after implementation was about half
		  completed, due to changing interests of graduate

  abstract =     {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS. In this paper, a unified 5-level architecture is proposed as a guideline for implementation of CPS.},

  abstract =     {In JavaScript handlers, callbacks are widely used to develop rich responsive and interactive Web applications. However, the dependency among nested callbacks, known as callback hell, can make it difficult to understand and maintain them, which will eventually mix concerns. Unfortunately, current solutions for JavaScript do not fully address the aforementioned issue. This paper presents Sync/cc, a JavaScript library that uses continuations and aspects to allow developers to write handlers that need nested callbacks in a synchronous style, preventing callback dependencies. Unlike current solutions, Sync/cc is modular, customizable, and succinct because it does not require special and scattered keywords, code refactoring, or adding ad-hoc implementations like state machines. In practice, our proposal uses a) continuations to only suspend the current handler execution until the asynchronous operation is resolved, and b) aspects to apply continuations in a non-intrusive way.},

This paper describes how reflection can benefit from a similar evolutionary path.}

  abstract =     {Cloud manufacturing is emerging as a novel business paradigm for the manufacturing industry, in which dynamically scalable and virtualised resources are provided as consumable services over the Internet. A handful of cloud manufacturing systems are proposed for different business scenarios, most of which fall into one of three deployment modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud, and public cloud. One of the challenges in the existing solutions is that few of them are capable of adapting to changes in the business environment. In fact, different companies may have different cloud requirements in different business situations; even a company at different business stages may need different cloud modes. Nevertheless, there is limited support on migrating to different cloud modes in existing solutions. This paper proposes a Hybrid Manufacturing Cloud that allows companies to deploy different cloud modes for their periodic business goals. Three typical cloud modes, i.e. private cloud, community cloud and public cloud are supported in the system. Furthermore, it enables companies to set self-defined access rules for each resource so that unauthorised companies will not have access to the resource. This self-managed mechanism gives companies full control of their businesses and boosts their trust with enhanced privacy protection. A unified ontology is developed to enhance semantic interoperability throughout the whole process of service provision in the clouds. A Cloud Management Engine is developed to manage all the user-defined clouds, in which Semantic Web technologies are used as the main toolkit. The feasibility of this approach is verified through a group of companies, each of which has complex access requirements for their resources. In addition, a use case is carried out between customers and service providers. This way, optimal service is delivered through the proposed system.},

  abstract =     {This paper discusses general requirements for architecture definition languages, and describes the syntax and semantics of the subset of the Rapide language that is designed to satisfy these requirements. Rapide is a concurrent event-based simulation language for defining and simulating the behavior of system architectures. Rapide is intended for modelling the architectures of concurrent and distributed systems, both hardware and software in order to represent the behavior of distributed systems in as much detail as possible. Rapide is designed to make the greatest possible use of event-based modelling by producing causal event simulations. When a Rapide model is executed it produces a simulation that shows not only the events that make up the model's behavior, and their timestamps, but also which events caused other events, and which events happened independently. The architecture definition features of Rapide are described: event patterns, interfaces, architectures and event pattern mappings. The use of these features to build causal event models of both static and dynamic architectures is illustrated by a series of simple examples from both software and hardware. Also we give a detailed example of the use of event pattern mappings to define the relationship between two architectures at different levels of abstraction. Finally, we discuss briefly how Rapide is related to other event-based languages.<<ETX>>},

  abstract =     {Statecharts is a visual language for specifying reactive system behavior. The formalism extends traditional finite-state machines with notions of hierarchy and concurrency, and it is used in many popular software design notations. A large part of the appeal of Statecharts derives from its basis in state machines, with their intuitive operational interpretation. The classical semantics of Statecharts, however, suffers from a serious defect; it is not compositional, meaning that the behavior of system descriptions cannot be inferred from the behavior of their subsystems. Compositionality is a prerequisite for exploiting the modular structure of Statecharts for simulation, verification, and code generation, and it also provides the necessary foundation for reusability.This paper suggests a new compositional approach to formalizing Statecharts semantics as flattened labeled transition systems in which transitions represent system steps. The approach builds on ideas developed for timed process calculi and employs structural operational rules to define the transitions of a Statecharts expression in terms of the transitions of its subexpressions. It is first presented for a simple dialect of Statecharts, with respect to a variant of Pnueli and Shalev's semantics, and is illustrated by means of a small example. To demonstrate its flexibility, the proposed approach is then extended to deal with practically useful features available in many Statecharts variants, namely state references, history states, and priority concepts along state hierarchies.},

This paper describes the design and implementation of
virtual memory management with the CMU Mach Operating System and the
experiences gained by the Mach kernel group in porting that system to
a variety of architectures. As of this writing, Mach runs on more than
half a dozen uniprocessors and multiprocessors, the IBM RT PC, the SUN
3, the Encore MultiMax, the Sequent Balance 21000 and several
experimental computers. Although these systems vary considerably in
the kind of hardware support for memory management they provide, the
machine-dependent portion of Mach virtual memory consists of a single
code module and its related header file. This separation of software
memory management from hardware support has been accomplished without
sacrificing system performance. In addition to improving portability,
it makes possible a relatively unbiased examination of the pros and
cons of various hardware memory management schemes, especially as
they apply to the support of multiprocessors."}

A bigraph consists of two independent structures: a topograph representing locality and an edge net representing connectivity. Bigraphs arc equipped with reaction rules to form bigraphical reactive systems (BRSs), which include versions of the $\pi$-calculus and the ambient calculus. A behavioural theory is established, using the categorical notion of relative pushout; it allows labelled transition systems to be derived uniformly for a wide variety of BRSs, in such a way that familiar behavioural prcordcrs and equivalences, in particular bisimilarity, are congruential. An example of the derivation is discussed.},

  abstract =     {Ubiquitous connectivity of web, mobile, and IoT computing platforms has fostered a variety of distributed applications with decentralized state. These applications execute across multiple devices with varying reliability and connectivity. Unfortunately, there is no declarative fault-tolerant programming model for distributed interactive applications with an inherently decentralized system model. We present a novel approach to automating fault tolerance using high-level programming abstractions tailored to the needs of distributed interactive applications. Specifically, we propose a calculus that enables formal reasoning about applications' dataflow within and across individual devices. Our calculus reinterprets the functional reactive programming model to seamlessly integrate its automated state change propagation with automated crash recovery of device-local dataflow and disconnection-tolerant distribution with guaranteed automated eventual consistency semantics based on conflict-free replicated datatypes. As a result, programmers are relieved of handling intricate details of distributing change propagation and coping with distribution failures in the presence of interactivity. We also provides proofs of our claims, an implementation of our calculus, and an empirical evaluation using a common interactive application.},

Cloud Computing (CC) is an important up to date computing concept for NE, as it offers significant financial and technical advantages beside high-level collaboration possibilities. As cloud computing is a new concept the solutions for handling interoperability, portability, security, privacy and standardization challenges have not been solved fully yet. The paper introduces the main characteristics of future Internet-based enterprises and the different CC models. An overview is given on interoperability and actual standardization issues in CC environments. A taxonomy on possible connecting forms of networked enterprises and cloud-based IT systems with reference on interoperability is introduced, parallel presenting four use cases as well. Finally, an example of connecting cloud and NE is presented as an effective application of cloud computing in manufacturing industry.}

  abstract =     {We introduce the Resource Aware Programming framework, which allows users to monitor the resources used by their programs and to programmatically express policies for the management of such resources. The framework is based on a notion of hierarchical groups, which act as resource containers for the computations they sponsor. Asynchronous notifications for resource exhaustion and for computation termination can be handled by arbitrary user code, which is also executed under the control of this hierarchical group structure. Resources are manipulated by the programmer using resource descriptors, whose operations are specified by a resource algebra. In this article, we overview the Resource Aware Programming framework and describe its semantics in the form of a language-independent abstract machine able to model both shared and distributed memory environments. Finally, we discuss a prototype implementation of the Resource Aware Programming framework in Java.}

In this paper, we investigate the degree of accuracy of alias and binding-time analyses that is required to successfully exploit the specialization opportunities present in the Sun commercial implementation of the remote procedure call protocol (RPC). The Sun RPC implementation consists of a stack of small parameterized layers. This structure is representative of a certain programming style in operating system and network development. The analysis features that we have explored have been implemented in Tempo, a partial evaluator for C. After automatic specialization of the RPC using Tempo, we measured speedups up to 1.5 for complete remote procedure calls (including network transport) and up to 3.7 for local buffer encoding alone. This experiment suggests that partial evaluation is reaching a high level of maturity.},

The adopted QVT specification has normalized some scheme of model transformation language; however several different model transformation language paradigms are likely to co-exist in the near future, ranging from imperative to declarative (including hybrid). It remains nevertheless questionable how model transformation specific languages compare to more general purpose languages, in terms of applicability, scalability and robustness. In this paper we report on our specific experience in applying an executable meta-language to the model transformation field.},

In particular we are concerned with the reuse of analysis and design information in addition to programming language code. The goal of the work on Draco has been to increase the productivity of software specialists in the construction of similar systems. The particular approach we have taken is to organize reusable software components by problem area or domain. Statements of programs in these specialized domains are then optimized by source-to-source program transformations and refined into other domains. The problems of maintaining the representational consistency of the developing program and producing efficient practical programs are discussed. Some examples from a prototype system are also given.},

  abstract =     {The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain. Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.},

One of the appealing features of the cloud is elasticity. It allows cloud users to acquire or release computing resources on demand, which enables web application providers to automatically scale the resources provisioned to their applications without human intervention under a dynamic workload to minimize resource cost while satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the challenges that remain in auto-scaling web applications in clouds and review the developments in this field. We present a taxonomy of auto-scalers according to the identified challenges and key properties. We analyze the surveyed works and map them to the taxonomy to identify the weaknesses in this field. Moreover, based on the analysis, we propose new future directions that can be explored in this area.},

In this context, the data is a valuable asset that can support the smart factory features through the use of Big Data and advanced analytics approaches. In order to address such requirements and related challenges, Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) promote the development of more intelligent, adaptable and responsiveness supervisory and control systems capable to overcome the inherent complexity and dynamics of industrial environments. In this context, this work presents an agent-based industrial CPS, where agents are endowed with data analysis capabilities for distributed, collaborative and adaptive process supervision and control. Additionally, to address the different industrial levels' requirements, this work combines two main data analysis scopes: at operational level, applying distributed data stream analysis for rapid response monitoring and control, and at supervisory level, applying big data analysis for decision-making, planning and optimization. Some experiments have been performed in the context of an electric micro grid where agents were able to perform distributed data analysis to predict the renewable energy production.},

A taxonomy of IaC defects can be useful for understanding the nature of defects, and identifying activities needed to fix and prevent defects in IaC scripts. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by developing a defect taxonomy for IaC scripts through qualitative analysis. We develop a taxonomy of IaC defects by applying qualitative analysis on 1,448 defect-related commits collected from open source software (OSS) repositories of the Openstack organization. We conduct a survey with 66 practitioners to assess if they agree with the identified defect categories included in our taxonomy. We quantify the frequency of identified defect categories by analyzing 80,425 commits collected from 291 OSS repositories spanning across 2005 to 2019.Our defect taxonomy for IaC consists of eight categories, including a category specific to IaC called idempotency (i.e., defects that lead to incorrect system provisioning when the same IaC script is executed multiple times). We observe the surveyed 66 practitioners to agree most with idempotency. The most frequent defect category is configuration data i.e., providing erroneous configuration data in IaC scripts. Our taxonomy and the quantified frequency of the defect categories may help in advancing the science of IaC script quality.},

The cloud infrastructure is also used for storage of historic data, for manufacturing set up and control (configuring resource teams for production orders received, selecting the control strategy choice, dynamic rescheduling of order execution in case of resource failure or rush order occurrence) and for hosting the web interface for: remote cell monitoring, reception of client requests, cell configuration, raw material inventory and reports generation.

System, its predecessor, the University of Rochester RIG system and
its successor CMU's Mach multiprocessor operating system. It outlines
the major design decisions on which the Accent kernel was based, how
these decisions evolved from the RIG experiences and how they had to
be modified to properly handled general purpose multiprocessors in
Mach. Also discussed are some of the major issues in the
implementation of message-based systems, the usage patterns observed
with Accent over a three year period of extensive use at CMU and a
timing analysis of various Accent functions.}

Some of the program-analysis problems that are amenable to this treatment include program slicing, certain dataflow-analysis problems, one version of the problem of approximating the possible âshapesâ that heap-allocated structures in a program can take on, and flow-insensitive points-to analysis. Relationships between graph reachability and other approaches to program analysis are described. Some techniques that go beyond pure graph reachability are also discussed.},

  abstract =     {The Industrial Internet should provide means to create ad hoc and loosely coupled information flows between objects, users, services, and business domain systems. However, today's technologies and products often feed `vertical silos' (e.g., vertical/siloed apps), which inevitably result in multiple and non-interoperable systems. Standardization will play an ever-increasing part in enabling information to flow between such vertically-oriented closed systems. This paper presents recent IoT messaging standards, notably O-MI (Open Messaging Interface) and O-DF (Open Data Format), whose initial requirements were defined for enhanced collaboration and interoperability in product lifecycle management. The performance of those standards is evaluated in terms of efficiency ratio, defined as the percentage of payload over traffic load. A first analytical model of the efficiency ratio based on the required/basic standard specifications is then proposed. A smart maintenance use case relying on the first version of the standard reference implementation is developed, based on which our analytical model is applied to evaluate the degree of deviation (w.r.t. the standard specifications) of this reference implementation.},

  abstract =     {Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) stand out as a particularly suitable paradigm for designing complex systems. Its elementary constituents are termed ``agents'', that is software entities which exhibit autonomous and flexible behaviours. However, most widely used models still consider agents as atomic entities. This may be a problem for MAS dedicated to the study and simulation of complex systems that frequently exhibit hierarchical structures. Indeed, almost all proposals for agent architectures have not addressed the general problem of treating collections of ``agents'' as higher-order entities, for example by treating organisations as agents. This chapter focuses on the definition of Holonic Multi-Agent Systems (HMAS) which are a special type of MAS based on the concept of ``holon''. Holons are self-similar entities that represent whole-part constructs and can be viewed either as higher-level system components or as wholes composed of other holons as substructures. Furthermore, a framework for engineering HMAS based on organisational concepts is introduced.},

A Horn clause transformation is used for the partial evaluation of a query in an intensional database, and its application to multiple query processing is discussed. Three strategies are presented for the compatible case, ordered case and crossed case. In each case, partial evaluation is used to preprocess the intensional database in order to obtain subqueries which direct access to an extensional database.},

University of Rochester.
The Psyche user interface is designed to allow programs with widely
differing concepts of process, sharing, protection, and communication
to run efficiently on the same machine, and to interact productively.
In addition, the Psyche development effort is addressing a host of
implementation issues for large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors,
including the organization of kernel functions, data structures, and
address maps for machines with non-uniform memory; the migration and
replication of pages to maximize locality; the introduction of
user-level device drivers, memory management, and scheduling; and
remote source-level kernel debugging.
We focus in this paper on our implementation of Psyche for the BBN
Butterfly Plus multiprocessor, though many of the issues we consider
apply to any operating system kernel on a large-scale shared-memory
machine.
We describe our major design decisions, the results of our initial
experience with the implementation, and our plans for continued
evaluation and experimentation with kernel implementation techniques."}

		  model. Multi-model parallel programming is the
		  simultaneous use of several different models, both
		  across programs and within a single program. This
		  paper describes multi-model parallel programming in
		  the Psyche multiprocessor operating system. We
		  explain why multi-model programming is desirable and

  abstract =     {The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a world-wide, interconnected network of smart physical entities. These physical entities generate a large amount of data in operation, and as the IoT gains momentum in terms of deployment, the combined scale of those data seems destined to continue to grow. Increasingly, applications for the IoT involve analytics. Data analytics is the process of deriving knowledge from data, generating value like actionable insights from them. This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective, and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches, and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics. This taxonomy provides us with insights on the appropriateness of analytical techniques, which in turn shapes a survey of enabling technology and infrastructure for IoT analytics. Finally, we look at some tradeoffs for analytics in the IoT that can shape future research.},

Motivation: "Instead of specifying the full behavior of the system, each property may focus on one particular aspect of system behavior. These properties may be written in a number of different specification formalisms, such as temporal logics, graphical finite-state machines, or regular expression notations, depending on the finite-state verification system that is being employed. Although, there are sometimes theoritical differences in the expressive power of these languages, these differences are rarely encountered in practice. A serious problem that is frequently encountered in practice, however, is expressing the intended behavior of the system correctly."}

However, partial evaluation is usually expressed as a source-to-source transformation for high-level languages, whereas realistic compilers produce object code.We close this gap by composing a partial evaluator with a compiler by automatic means. Our work is a successful application of several meta-computation techniques to build the system, both in theory and in practice. The composition is an application of deforestation or fusion.The result is a run-time code generation system built from existing components. Its applications are numerous. For example, it allows the language designer to perform interpreter-based experiments with a source-to-source version of the partial evaluator before building a realistic compiler which generates object code automatically.},

Being highly scalable and fault tolerant, such algorithms are ideal in the operation of large-scale distributed systems. Furthermore, even though the model of local algorithms is very limited, in recent years we have seen many positive results for nontrivial problems. This work surveys the state-of-the-art in the field, covering impossibility results, deterministic local algorithms, randomized local algorithms, and local algorithms for geometric graphs.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents the design of a holonic manufacturing execution system. The design is an instantiation of the PROSA reference architecture [1] augmented with coordination and control mechanisms inspired by natural systems â i.e. food foraging behavior in ant colonies. Research prototypes are implemented as multi-agent systems. The main coordination and control mechanisms ensure that the process plans are properly executed and emergently forecast the workload of the manufacturing resources as well as well as lead times and routings of the products. The design empowers the product instances to drive their own production; the coordination is completely decentralized. In contrast to many decentralized designs, the manufacturing execution system predicts future behavior and proactively takes measures to prevent impending problems from happening. A social control mechanism ensures that product instances adhere sufficiently to their declared intentions, which is necessary to guarantee adequate forecast accuracy. The design has been applied to an industrial test case, and the paper discusses results of this case study.},

  abstract =     {Cloud computing is changing the way industries and enterprises do their businesses in that dynamically scalable and virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet. This model creates a brand new opportunity for enterprises. In this paper, some of the essential features of cloud computing are briefly discussed with regard to the end-users, enterprises that use the cloud as a platform, and cloud providers themselves. Cloud computing is emerging as one of the major enablers for the manufacturing industry; it can transform the traditional manufacturing business model, help it to align product innovation with business strategy, and create intelligent factory networks that encourage effective collaboration. Two types of cloud computing adoptions in the manufacturing sector have been suggested, manufacturing with direct adoption of cloud computing technologies and cloud manufacturingâthe manufacturing version of cloud computing. Cloud computing has been in some of key areas of manufacturing such as IT, pay-as-you-go business models, production scaling up and down per demand, and flexibility in deploying and customizing solutions. In cloud manufacturing, distributed resources are encapsulated into cloud services and managed in a centralized way. Clients can use cloud services according to their requirements. Cloud users can request services ranging from product design, manufacturing, testing, management, and all other stages of a product life cycle.},

		  important component of the Mach design is the use of
		  memory objects which can be managed either by the
		  kernel or by user programs through a message
		  interface. This feature allows applications such as
		  transaction management systems to participate in
		  decisions regarding secondary storage managemement
		  and page replacement. This paper explores the goals,
		  design and implementation of Mach and its external
		  memory management facility. The relationship between
		  memory and communication in Mach is examined as it
		  relates to overall performance, applicability of
		  Mach to new multiprocessors architectures, and the
		  structure of application programs."

The concept of CMfg, including its architecture, typical characteristics and the key technologies for implementing a CMfg service platform, is discussed. Three core components for constructing a CMfg system, i.e. CMfg resources, manufacturing cloud service and manufacturing cloud are studied, and the constructing method for manufacturing cloud is investigated. Finally, a prototype of CMfg and the existing related works conducted by the authors' group on CMfg are briefly presented.},
